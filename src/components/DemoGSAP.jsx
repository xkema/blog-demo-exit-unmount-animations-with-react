      <p>Implementing the same logic with GSAP was a little bit challenging then the others. There is no built-in solution for exit/unmount animations in the library and it uses an imperative approach to build animations. It is a framework-agnostic library and uses a lower-level abstraction and makes you ask more questions then other libraries. I think I will write another article about GSAP, so I will stop to try explaining things for now.</p>
      <p>The challenging part was mostly about the &quot;context-safe&quot; context (pun intended) and the &quot;cleaup logic&quot; comes with the React helper <code>useGSAP</code> hook.</p>
      <p>In summary, as we did in the problem definition and react transition group demos, we also need to manually delay when React unmounts the animated element with listening to the <code>onAnimationEnd</code> event.</p>
      <p>To make the demo code simple I separated enter and exit logic to the parent and child components. So exit is handled in the parent, enter is handled in the animated component body. (There is a reason for that I will try to explain in a separate post.) One more thing. Exit animation is created again and again here. Using <code>forwardRef</code> + <code>useImperativeHandler</code> or saving the recreated animation into a <code>useRef</code> hook were 2 solution I could come up with. But  again, for the sake of simplicity. I skipped them.</p>
